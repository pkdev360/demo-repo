## Git Abbreviations:-

- `repo` -> repository
- `clone` -> bring a repo down from the internet (remote repository like Github) to your local machine
- `add` -> track your files and changes with Git
- `commit` -> save your changes into Git
- `push` -> push your changes to your remote repo on Github (or another website)
- `pull` -> pull changes down from the remote repo to your local machine
